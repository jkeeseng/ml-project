# Koala Classification Project

This project aims to classify audio samples to determine whether they are related to koalas or not. It utilizes machine learning techniques, data augmentation, and audio feature extraction to build an effective classification model.

## Features

- **Audio Data Preprocessing**: Handles raw audio data, including cleaning, filtering, and augmentation.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trains a classification model to distinguish between koala-related and non-koala-related audio samples.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides detailed metrics for evaluating model performance, such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Dataset

- **Koala Samples**: 540 audio samples (including augmented data).
- **Non-Koala Samples**: 560 audio samples.
- **Data Format**: Audio recordings.

## Requirements

The project uses the following dependencies:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `librosa`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `jupyter`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jkeeseng/ml-project.git
   cd ml-project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the notebook file:
   ```
   koala classification project-1.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the step-by-step instructions to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Results

- The classification model achieved high accuracy in identifying koala-related audio samples.
- Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations are available in the notebook.

## Future Work

- Explore advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning.
- Extend the dataset to include more diverse audio samples.
- Optimize the model for real-time audio classification.
